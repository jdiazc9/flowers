Apr 25 2021

Started cultures of some isolates from the jdc-isolates plate in LB.
I chose the first two rows of the plate (A3 to B10) for Enterobacteriaceae
and the 4th and 5th rows (D5 to E10) for Pseudomonadaceae.

Isolates are labeled in order as E1, E2, E3... and P1, P2, P3...
for Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonadaceae respectively.

Apr 26 2021

I streaked each culture in LB agar plates.

Apr 27 2021

I picked a single colony from each plate* and put it in 2mL of LB in
snap cap Falcon tubes. I put in the incubator at 30deg.

*Some plates showed multiple colony morphologies (presumed contamination).
I will deal with this tomorrow.

Apr 28 2021

I put 5uL of each culture in chromogenic medium plates and incubated at 30deg.

Apr 29 2021

All E cultures appear to be Enterobacteriaceae indeed (white to yellow colonies
in chromogenic).

Most P cultures appear to be Pseudomonadaceae indeed (blue colonies
in chromogenic).

Exceptions:
    - P10 and P12 are light blue/turquoise (Citrobacter?).
      I went back to the streaked plates and picked new colonies, put them in
      LB and incubated at 30deg.
      Before incubating, I shaked the tubes thorughly and plated 25uL in chromogenic.
    - P14 is dark blue (probably Enterobacteriaceae).
      I went back to the streaked plate and picked two colonies with different
      morphologies (this is one of the plates that showed contamination). I picked 
      one white-ish colony and one yelow-ish colony.
      Again, I shaked the tubes thoroughly and put 25uL in chromogenic.

If this doesn't solve the issues, it is OK to substitute P10, P12 and P14 for
some other P strains (e.g. P6, P7 and P8 respectively). This is the safest option
to start the monocultures tomorrow.

Apr 30 2021

The two colonies of P14 that I picked (P14w, the white colony; and P14y, the yellow
colony) resulted in weird results in chromogenic:
    - P14w seems to be indeed an Enterobacteriaceae (dark blue in chromogenic)
    - P14y gave a mix of white and dark blue spots in chromogenic, indicating that
      I most likely picked two species at re-isolation (colonies were very close
      to one another so it's very possible that I picked up two)
I could re-isolate P14y to get a monoculture of the Pseudomonadaceae, but I don't
think it's worth the trouble. It's easier to just subtitute P14 for one of the
other Pseudomonadaceae.

P10 and P12 gave the same results as yesterday (still light blue/greenish in
chromogenic, possible Citrobacter).

We will thus be making the following substitutions:

P10 -> P6
P12 -> P7
P14 -> P8

I inoculated all cultures between 10am and 11am with 1/500th of the final volumes
from the starters (see communities.xlsx for volumes).
I left cultures to grow at room temperature (roughly 22deg).

I also got some cryogenic tubes ready with 500uL glycerol 80%. Tomorrow I will add
500uL of each monoculture to them and freeze at -80deg.

I am somewhat concerned about cross-contamination when pipetting. Especially for
the cultures for which I needed a larger inoculum volume (max. was 1000uL), the
mixing I did prior to inoculating may have led to some droplets being deposited
on the pipette. This could have led to some carryover to the next inoculum. The
effect will be hard to notice in cryogenic medium, since contaminations would be
from the same family.
I tried to be careful with this and cleaned the pipette with ethanol several times
between inoculations. I think we should be OK but it would be nice to check leter
on (maybe streaking plates? colony morphologies should be too similar to detect
evident contamination, but maybe it would be useful in some cases...)

Apr 1 2021

Assembled the communities:
- Centrifuged every monoculture in batched of 50mL at 3000rpm for 10min
  (gently to avoid crushing cells)
- Re-suspended every batch into 5ml of PBS to obtain 10X concentrated monocultures
- Used the concentrated monocultures to assemble the communities (mixing equal volumes
  of every isolate according to table in communities.xlsx)

I went to the CAES farm and helped Quan Zeng spray my communities over the trees.
There were 20 trees, 2 of them were left as a control (no spraying). Of the other
18 trees, we used 2 trees per treatment. We sprayed 9 treatments total, corresponding
to communities 1 to 9 and community 10. Community 9 was not used. Trees labeled as
'9' correspond to community 10. All other trees are labeled according to the community
they were sprayed with.

Apr 3 2021

Went back to the CAES farm. Collected 20 flowers per tree and brought them back
to our lab to freeze at -80deg. Avoided picking newly bloomed flowers so we don't
end up with ones that bloomed after the spraying 2 days ago.

In the afternoon, I helped Quan Zeng spray Erwinia over the trees.

Apr 5 2021

Went back to the CAES farm. Collected 30 flowers per tree, froze at -80deg.

I also used the starters of my isolate monocultures to make glycerol stocks.
I put the glycerol stocks in Anna (-80deg).

Apr 6 2021

I took the concentrated monocultures (that I had prepared n Apr 1). Transfered
1mL of each monoculture to a 96 deep-well plate:
- E1 to E8 in wells A3 to A10
- E9 to E16 in wells B3 to B10
- P1 to P8 in wells D3 to D10
- P9 to P16 in wells E3 to E10
Centrifuged at 3000rpm for 30min to pellet the cells. Removed supernatant and
froze at -80deg for later sequencing (if needed).
